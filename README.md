In this project is a CRUD application simple building with Django and adapted to be a serverless aplication with an interface of API's building a complete API REST (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE).

This project could be adapt to any of hyperscalers that have a service function-based and interface of API REST that can redirect any user request based on their behaviour. In this case, I choose to use Huawei Cloud services:

1- FunctionGraph: Serverless services that trigger functions based on events or HTTP request
2- APIG: API REST to host the APIs and configuring the verb (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE), endpoints, parameters, headers and bandwidth or the request.
